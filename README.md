<h1>Building Log</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This application serves to simulate employee entries and exits from a business building, aiming to streamline workforce management within corporate settings. As the sole developer of this project, I made deliberate choices regarding the technologies utilized. In selecting InfluxDB as the database solution, I opted for its exceptional quality as a time-series database. This choice enables efficient storage and management of a vast array of events over extended periods. Leveraging time-series data, I aimed to preserve all occurrences over time, laying the groundwork for potential future data analysis.

Moreover, the application was specifically developed to serve the Air Flow Monitor application (https://github.com/tamaraantic/AirFlowMonitor). This integration is crucial as the Air Flow Monitor application relies on real-time information about employee presence within the building. By accurately tracking employee movements, the system ensures that Air Flow Monitor can promptly notify employees about sensor readings within the premises, enhancing overall operational efficiency and safety protocols.
